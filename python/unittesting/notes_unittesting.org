#+TITLE: Unit Testing Notes with Python

* What is Testing? 
+ Testing: writing code that invodes code under test to determine if there are
  any errors. 
+ It does NOT prove that code is correct, only the developer thought is correct
+ Errors that can be detected:
  + syntax error
  + Logic error
+ Unit: a single unit of code *in isolation*
  + a module
  + a single class / function
  + anything in between

* Why Testing? 
+ Make sure code works properly under a given set of conditions
+ Allows one to ensore that code changes did not break existing functionality
+ Force one to think about unusual conditions
+ Requirs modular, decoupled code 

* Testing Tips: 
+ Each test should test a single, specific property of the code and be named
  accordingly. 

* Going Forward
+ Test case organization
+ Continuous integration
+ Test case management
