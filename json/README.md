## JSON

**About:** sample CMakeLists.txt and source code to use jsoncpp library. 

**CMakeLists.txt** uses CMake's FindPkgConfig module to find jsoncpp library, thus only works in system with pkg-config installed and probabily  will not work in Windows.

**example.cpp** shows how to use the jsoncpp API, which is extremely simple and user friendly. 

**config.json** is a sample json file from jsoncpp.sourceforge.com and works with the example code. To run this example, you need to run under the source dir (for file open).
